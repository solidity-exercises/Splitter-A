# Splitter-A
Implementation of the Splitter exercise
<p>You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:</p>
<ul>
    <li>there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol</li>
    <li>we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the
        web page</li>
    <li>whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it
        goes to Bob and the other half to Carol</li>
    <li>we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the
        web page</li>
    <li>we can send ether to it from the web page</li>
</ul>
<p>Stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>add a kill switch to the whole contract</li>
    <li>make the contract a utility that can be used by David,
        Emma and anybody with an address</li>
    <li>cover potentially bad input data</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setup CI with tool by your choice.</li>
    <li>Unit test your implementation</li>
    <li>Set up test coverage with <a href="https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage">solidity-coverage</a>
        and achieve >90% code coverage.</li>
</ul>
